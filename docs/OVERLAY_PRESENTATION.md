# Overlay presentation handoff

The Founder supplied channel-bar, capsule and channel-popover designs on
2026-10-20 and asked for a visual layer Monika can reshape without rebuilding
capture or bus handling. Those images are visual directions, with several
alternative arrangements; this document does not select one as the final UI.

## Start with the visual owner

| Change                                                               | Existing owner                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent name, clock, descriptor and message preview                    | `OverlayAgentRosterLabel.swift`                                                         |
| Row footer, action grouping, broadcast row and compact channel pills | `OverlayChannelStatusView.swift`                                                        |
| Header, waveform placement, embedded list/rail and hover region      | `DictationOverlayView.swift`                                                            |
| List width, docking threshold and rail/pill dimensions               | `OverlayAgentDrawerLayout.swift`                                                        |
| Native mini/midi/expanded window size, position and morph            | `DictationOverlayWindow.swift`                                                          |
| Overlay colors                                                       | `OverlayAppearancePalette.swift`, projecting `CSPalette` in `DesignSystem/Tokens.swift` |
| Shared microphone/speaker symbols, glass and hit areas               | `OverlayAgentAudioControls` in `OverlayChannelStatusView.swift`                         |

Swift source paths above are relative to
`macos/Codescribe/Screens/Overlay/`, except `DesignSystem/Tokens.swift`.
The XcodeGen app target includes `Codescribe` recursively; add a visual view
there rather than maintaining a second source list or editing generated projects.

`OverlayAgentRosterLabel` receives immutable display values: title, channel and
conversation IDs, descriptor, preview, timestamp, unread count, status dot and
accessible explanations, reception policy, palette and text scale. It does not
receive `OverlayState`, a controller, bindings, commands, tasks or a bus reader.
`rosterRowLabel` in `OverlayChannelStatusView` composes those values once per
row. Restyle that view, or compose the same projections into a different visual
surface. Keep the policy symbol/help from `AgentBroadcastPolicy`; its meaning
does not belong to the visual style. `OverlayAgentUnreadBadge` is shared by
current and saved conversations.

The row's primary action and its microphone, speaker, Frame and archive actions
are siblings. The identity/clock, descriptor and preview receive the full row
width; the footer owns only its own compact action group. Moving controls must
not turn the whole row into one button or nest buttons inside another button.
The current budget is five text lines: identity, descriptor, up to two preview
lines, and footer state. Preserve it when changing spacing or typography.

## Reuse the projections and commands

`OverlayState` remains the UI projection and command coordinator. Its
`visibleChannelRows`, `channelHudStates`, conversations, selection, pending
commands and errors feed `channelStatusView` in `DictationOverlayView`.
`OverlayChannelDelivery` and `OverlayChannelHudProjection` carry evidence;
`OverlayAgentGlyph` and the existing status helpers render that evidence.
No visual component should poll another roster, cache another conversation,
create receipt state or open a recorder.

| Visual interaction             | Existing path to preserve                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reveal/fold the agent list     | `unfoldAgentList`, `foldAgentList` and existing sidebar callbacks |
| Select a conversation          | `onSelectConversation` / `chooseConversation`                     |
| Toggle microphone for a digit  | `onToggleChannel`, then `OverlayState` and the controller         |
| Toggle reply playback          | `onTogglePlayback` / conversation playback command                |
| Open the agent's terminal pane | `canFocusAgentPanel` and `focusAgentPanel`, with the exact owner  |
| Archive an agent               | `onArchiveAgent`, with the exact conversation owner               |
| Change broadcast reception     | `OverlayBroadcastPolicyMenu` and its existing command             |

These callbacks already carry pending/error and availability guards. A new
popover or horizontal map should use those paths, retaining selection as
navigation and microphone controls as explicit capture commands. A channel
digit or display name alone is not a session identity.

Below the UI, `RecordingController` owns the microphone,
`app/controller/delivery_route.rs` owns delivery routing,
`TranscriptReducer` owns the transcript and
`app/presentation/transcript_bus.rs` observes committed events. A design change
does not need changes to these owners.

## Requirements that survive a new skin

- In the expanded overlay, the compact agent rail and its reveal button are
  available from the first reveal, before any conversation has been selected.
  A visible full list replaces the rail. Hover over the folded rail reveals
  that same list. Do not mount either only after opening an agent conversation.
- The conversation's agent pill focuses an available, detected Frame pane.
  When that target is unavailable, the label stays passive; a new shell must
  not display an unsupported navigation option.
- Capture-open, follower-alive, queued, acknowledged, unread and speaking are
  different facts. ACK confirms receipt, not task completion. Color, elapsed
  time, a hover animation or an unread badge must not manufacture a receipt.
- Scale text through the existing text-scale projection, preserve Reduce
  Motion/Reduce Transparency, tooltips, keyboard focus and accessibility IDs.
  Change a symbol's font separately from the button's hit area.
- Use the existing palette roles. A one-line bar and a two-row bar are layout
  choices, not reasons for a second status palette or persisted channel model.
  If a design needs a different native window size, update the existing window
  owner and its geometry checks together; SwiftUI layout alone cannot prove it.

## Integration and visual acceptance

This document is not proof of a running design. On 2026-10-20 the Founder
assigned Astra the UI/UX lane and explicitly authorized both Astra and Lena to
compile their separate scopes, superseding the earlier source-only assignment.
Keep unfinished generations in their worktrees; the main checkout must remain
stable and installable. Check the admitted generation at first launch with no
selected conversation; folded/expanded lists; wide/narrow windows; channel 0
and individual agents; pending, unavailable and disconnected states; and the
supplied large-text screenshots. Geometry checks should cover row widths
240/300/400 at text scales 1.0/1.5/2.0, including trailing clock alignment,
button bounds and the five-line budget. Preserve action and accessibility
coverage when moving a view to another file; source-shape assertions may need
to follow the new owner.
